# Steam Listings Scanner
Google Chrome extension for Steam Community Market's work simplifying and semi-automating.

Extension functions for now:
- scanning for relevance your buy order list. Marks each order with color (green = good, yellow = too low (as set in popup window), red = overpriced)
- cancelling overpriced or too low orders
- displaying "market_listing_price_without_fee" under the price of each lot on the item page
- ability to show more buy orders on the item page. Quantity sets up in the popup window
- autoscan (experimental). Scans your order list with set interval. ALWAYS cancels overpriced orders. Doesn't cancel too low orders.
